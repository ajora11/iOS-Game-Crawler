This is a simple project that crawls iOS games from iTunes website. 

In this project, I have used .NET Core v2.1 as back-end and Angular 7 as front-end. Sqlite is used to store game data.

To run project:

1. Open a command line in CrawlerApp.API folder and run "dotnet run"
2. Open a command line in CrawlerAppSPA folder and run "npm install" and "ng serve" consecutively
3. Open "http://localhost:4200" in your browser
